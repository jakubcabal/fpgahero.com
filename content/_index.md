# About the FPGA Hero

We are a bunch of FPGA engineers 🧑‍💻 who decided to write posts about the amazing technology of FPGA chips.
We don’t need a website with a fancy template,
we want quality and useful content that will interest our colleagues 🤓 and the FPGA community.

We only create the fpgahero.com blog in our free time ⏱️,
so please excuse the fact that sometimes it takes us a while to publish a new post.
Nevertheless, we want to share our many years of experience working with FPGA chips 🚀 and developing RTL designs 👨‍🔬.

**[So come and read our posts...](./blog)**

And don't forget to follow us on the Mastodon: [@fpgahero@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@fpgahero)
